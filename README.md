## Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic

Case Study: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
This analysis is based on the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study, which is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification capstone project.

Cyclistic is a fictitious Chicago-based bike-sharing company.

In this case study, the phases of Google data analysis are followed: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

This RMarkdown report, created with Rstudio, focuses on the Prepare, Process, Analyze, Visualize, Share, and Act phases.

You can find a detailed analysis and documentation of its phases  [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tRSRAdU-vXw_QFkk6xtROzSNzotKwZqpSmwgzi_Nfxg/edit#heading=h.qags1g1r4txe)
